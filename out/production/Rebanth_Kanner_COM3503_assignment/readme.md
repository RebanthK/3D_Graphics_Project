# COM3503 Assignment

Student Name:Rebanth Kanner

# Running instructions
    A Hatch.bat file has been created to help run the program. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT RUNNING "javac Hatch.java" sometimes does not compile the required classes and can cause errors

# Credits
Most of the classes have been adapted from the chapter 7 labs. However Hatch_GLEventListener.java is where the functionality has been implemented and is my own work.
Two additional shaders have also been made (vs_tt_06.txt, fs_tt_06.txt)
